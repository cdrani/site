# PBL: Project Based Learning

In my efforts to learn Cloud & DevOps this year and transition into a Cloud/DevOps Engineer, I have steeled myself to follow a program to implement 25-30 projects with ever-increasing difficulty to gain experience in working with tools/services like AWS (S3, EC2, EBS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and many others in helping to deploy, automate, continuously release, and monitor status/health/usage of live applications. That's already a long list of technologies I am not too familiar with and integrating them is currently a mystery to me, but hopefully, through a PBL approach, I can slowly introduce them as the projects get more complex.

# What is PBL?

PBL is a learning/teaching method to develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems one may face in the real world. Each project should work towards the ultimate goal of expanding my DevOps knowledge base and gaining experience in industry tools.

PBL is organized around an open-ended driving question or challenge, creating a need-to-know essential content and skills, which in turn requires inquiry to learn and/or create something new.
